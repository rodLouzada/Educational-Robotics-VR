Hello, (Virtual) World! is designed to be an immersive experience. We found in Virtual Reality (VR) a new way to introduce users to programming by immersing young learners into practical examples.

Programming is a challenging skill to acquire. Many researchers have been trying to understand the pitfalls for young learners. Studies have found that many struggle to understand and apply certain abstract programming concepts when solving a problem. There are different reasons for these problems, including that: Programming demands a high abstraction level; Programming needs a competent level of both knowledge and practical problem solving techniques; and teaching cannot be individualized due to common class size; Programming is mostly dynamic, but usually taught using static materials.

With regards to the difficulties of learning how to program we proposed a VR-Experience in which we immerse the user in a virtual environment and bring abstract concepts such as functions and loops to a more tangible representation. We can also individualize the teaching, meaning a user could have available at any time a virtual instructor to explain and guide through programming examples.

As we mentioned, programming is inherently abstract. One practical, fun example for the usability and functionality of algorithms is robotics. One could program a robotic arm to grab a box and later see the instructions brought to life being executed by the robot. However, robotic parts can be costly as well as programming robots can require a complex understanding of electrical and computer engineering.

In this project, we propose a virtual environment that abstracts the deep electronic knowledge of robotics and the specific syntax of programming languages for a simple coding with blocks as well as a lego-like approach to assemble robots.
